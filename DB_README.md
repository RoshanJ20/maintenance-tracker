# Database Schema Status

## Current State

We are using a **SIMPLE schema** that's already implemented and working.

### Active Schema Document
📄 **`CURRENT_SCHEMA.md`** - The actual database structure being used

### Archived for Future
📦 **`DATABASE_SCHEMA_FUTURE.md`** - Complex schema for future expansion (NOT implemented)

---

## What's Actually in the Database Right Now

### ✅ Working Tables

1. **`users`**
   - `id` (UUID) - Primary key
   - `role` (TEXT) - CHECK: 'admin' or 'maintainer'
   - `name` (TEXT, nullable)
   - `email` (TEXT, nullable)

2. **`assets`**
   - `id` (UUID) - Primary key, auto-generated
   - `name` (TEXT) - Required
   - `type` (TEXT) - Required
   - `description` (TEXT, nullable)
   - `purchasedate` (DATE, nullable)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-set
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-updated via trigger

3. **`tasks`**
   - `id` (UUID) - Primary key, auto-generated
   - `asset_id` (UUID, nullable) - Foreign key to assets (CASCADE delete)
   - `task_name` (TEXT) - Required
   - `last_done_date` (DATE, nullable)
   - `next_due_date` (DATE, nullable)
   - `frequency_days` (INTEGER, nullable) - How often task repeats
   - `notified` (BOOLEAN) - Default false, tracks if notification sent
   - `notes` (TEXT, nullable)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-set
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Auto-updated via trigger

**Triggers:**
- `update_assets_updated_at` - Automatically updates `updated_at` on asset changes
- `update_tasks_updated_at` - Automatically updates `updated_at` on task changes

## Philosophy: Keep It Simple

We're following the **YAGNI principle** (You Aren't Gonna Need It):
- ✅ Build what you need now
- ✅ Keep it simple and working
- ✅ Add complexity only when required
- ❌ Don't over-engineer early

The complex schema in `DATABASE_SCHEMA_FUTURE.md` is there when we need:
- Advanced scheduling
- Parts inventory
- Work orders
- File attachments
- Notification system
- Detailed audit logs

But for now, **simple is better**! 🎯

## Next Steps When Ready

When you need more features, we can gradually enhance:

### Phase 1 (Easy Wins)
Add these fields to existing tables:
- `assets`: location, status, description
- `maintenance_tasks`: title, status, assigned_to

### Phase 2 (When Needed)
Add new tables one at a time:
- Task schedules
- Parts tracking
- Attachments

### Phase 3 (Enterprise Features)
Implement the full schema from `DATABASE_SCHEMA_FUTURE.md`

## Current Focus

Right now, we're focused on:
1. ✅ Tabs interface (DONE!)
2. 🎯 Basic CRUD for users, tasks, and assets
3. 🎯 Simple task assignment
4. 🎯 Basic reporting

Keep building on what works! 🚀
